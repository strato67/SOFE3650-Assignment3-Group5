# Model View Controller

##advantages:
+Good modularity


-High coupling


# Model View Controller with Interfaces

+Removes coupling through interfaces

+Easy to implement new objects for future use cases

+Good code reusability

-Strict modularity, requires updating individual classes that implements the interface


# Observer Pattern

+Loose coupling between the objects

+Efficently update objects without modifying the observer class 

-Notifications passed by observer can fail in certain scenarios
